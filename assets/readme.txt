Upload files into this folder, such as images or videos.

To embed that file in the published page, make sure to use the relative path.

For example, if you upload an image called interface.jpg in this folder, within README.md, you can embed it using:

![User interface](assets/interface.jpg)

OR you can write pure HTML, such as:

<img src="assets/interface.jpg" alt="User interface">
